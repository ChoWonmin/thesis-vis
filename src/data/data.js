        "abstract": "This paper describes the design and implementation of a methodology for the visualisation and hypothetical virtual reconstruction of Roman polychrome statuary for research purposes. The methodology is intended as an attempt to move beyond visualisations which are simply believable towards a more physically accurate approach. Accurate representations of polychrome statuary have great potential utility both as a means of illustrating existing interpretations and as a means of testing and revising developing hypotheses. The goal of this methodology is to propose a pipeline which incorporates a high degree of physical accuracy whilst also being practically applicable in a conventional archaeological research setting. The methodology is designed to allow the accurate visualisation of surviving objects and colourants as well as providing reliable methods for the hypothetical reconstruction of elements which no longer survive. The process proposed here is intended to limit the need for specialist recording equipment, utilising existing data and those data which can be collected using widely available technology. It is at present being implemented as part of the 'Statues in Context' project at Herculaneum and will be demonstrated here using the case study of a small area of the head of a painted female statue discovered at Herculaneum in 2006.",

In the present study, we have identified different psychology related theme words while analyzing emotions on the interview data of ISEAR (International Survey of Emotion Antecedents and Reactions) research group. Primarily, we have developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to generate visual graphs for analyzing the impact of emotions with respect to different background, behavioral and physiological variables available in the ISEAR dataset. We have discussed some of the interesting results as observed from the generated visual graphs. On the other hand, different text clusters are identified from the interview statements by selecting individual as well as different combinations of the variables. Such textual clusters are used not only for retrieving the psychological theme words but also to classify the theme words into their respective emotion classes. In order to retrieve the psychological theme words from the text clusters, we have developed a rule based baseline system considering unigram based keyword spotting technique. The system has been evaluated based on a Top-n ranking strategy (where n=10, 20 or 30 most frequent theme words). Overall, the system achieves the average F-Scores of .42, .32, .36, .42, .35, .40 and .40 in identifying theme words with respect to Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Guilt, Sadness and Shame emotion classes, respectively.",

The first system displays the lateral shape of the vocal tract for each vowel estimated from the speech sound. In this system, three storages are prepared. One of them can be used to store a reference shape which may be estimated from a teacher's voice or a prepared standard shape. A child can articulate seeing the reference shape and re-articulate comparing his own first articulation with the reference shape. The system can also compare the estimated shape with the reference one and produce instructions with animated cartoons which show where any articulatory defects exist. The second system displays successively the lateral shapes for articulation of any phoneme sequences containing consonants. The third system displays the first two formant frequencies extracted from speech as a spot on the F1-F2 plane, where the regions of vowels are shown in color. Preliminary use of these devices has shown that they complement each other to form a more effective system of speech training.",

The difficulty is estimated by valuation functions based on the \"recognizability\" and \"visibility\" of landmarks.

        "abstract": "Previous language modeling approaches to information retrieval have focused primarily on single terms. The use of bigram models has been studied, but the restriction on word order and adjacency may not be justified for information retrieval. We propose a new language modeling approach to information retrieval that incorporates lexical affinities, or pairs of words that occur near each other, without a constraint on word order. The use of compound terms in the vector space model has been shown to outperform the vector model with only single terms (Nie & Dufort, 2002). We explore the use of compound terms in a language modeling approach, and compare our results with the vector space model, and unigram and bigram language model approaches.",

        "abstract": "Spatial encryption is a generic public-key cryptosystem where vectors play the role of public keys and secret keys are associated to affine spaces. Any secret key associated to a space can decrypt all ciphertexts encrypted for vectors in that space, and the delegation relation is defined by subspace inclusion. Though several constructions of spatial encryption schemes have been proposed in the literature, none of them are known to remain secure in the leakage-resilient setting, in which the adversary may be capable of learning limited additional information about the master secret key and other secret keys in the system. In this paper, we propose the first spatial encryption scheme achieving leakage resilience in the standard model, based on existing static assumptions over bilinear groups of composite order. Our new scheme is based on the leakageresilient HIBE scheme by Lewko, Rouselakis, and Waters in TCC 2011 and can be seen as a generalization of Moriyama-Doi spatial encryption scheme to the leakage-resilient setting.",

While business views are identified in many Enterprise Architecture (EA) proposals, business strategy formulations from the area of Strategic Management are overlooked. Thus, IT solutions cannot be traced back to business strategy in a clear and unambiguous way. Our intended proposal, a Unified Business Strategy Meta-Model (UBSMM), aims at establishing such a link. UBSMM is a formalization of the integration of known business strategy formulations with precise semantics enabling its model-level usage to provide strategic awareness to Enterprise Architecture. In this paper we present the development process of UBSMM, and further, we propose conceptual relationships towards Enterprise Architecture (EA).",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women. Early diagnosis is necessary for effective treatment and therefore of crucial importance. Medical thermography has been demonstrated an effective and inexpensive method for detecting breast cancer, in particular in early stages and in dense tissue. In this paper, we propose a medical decision support system based on analysing bilateral asymmetries in breast thermograms. The underlying data is imbalanced, as the number of benign cases significantly exceeds that of malignant ones, which will lead to problems for conventional pattern recognition algorithms. To address this, we propose an ensemble classifier system which is based on the idea of Clustering and Selection. The feature space, which is derived from a series of image symmetry features, is partitioned in order to decompose the problem into a set of simpler decision areas. We then delegate a locally competent classifier to each of the generated clusters. The set of predictors is composed of both standard models as well as models dedicated to imbalanced classification, so that we are able to employ a specialised classifier to clusters that show high class imbalance, while maintaining a high specificity for other clusters. We demonstrate that our method provides excellent classification performance and that it statistically outperforms several state-of-the-art ensembles dedicated to imbalanced problems.",

        "abstract": "The development of an automated system for the quality assessment of aerodrome ground lighting (AGL), in accordance with associated standards and recommendations, is presented. The system is composed of an image sensor, placed inside the cockpit of an aircraft to record images of the AGL during a normal descent to an aerodrome. A model-based methodology is used to ascertain the optimum match between a template of the AGL and the actual image data in order to calculate the position and orientation of the camera at the instant the image was acquired. The camera position and orientation data are used along with the pixel grey level for each imaged luminaire, to estimate a value for the luminous intensity of a given luminaire. This can then be compared with the expected brightness for that luminaire to ensure it is operating to the required standards. As such, a metric for the quality of the AGL pattern is determined. Experiments on real image data is presented to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the system.",

        "abstract": "Quality specified image retrieval is helpful to improve the user experiences in mobile searching and social media sharing. However, the model for evaluating the quality of the user generated images, which are popular in social media sharing, remains unexploited. In this paper, we propose a scheme for quality assessment on user generated image. The scheme is formed by four attribute dimensions, including intrinsic quality, favorability, relevancy and accessibility of images. Each of the dimensions is defined and modeled to pool a final quality score of a user generated image. The proposed scheme can reveal the quality of user generated image in comprehensive manner. Experimental results show that the scores obtained by our scheme have high correlation coefficients with the benchmark data. Therefore, our scheme is suitable for quality specified image retrieval on mobile applications.",
